# ModHub
This is a Basic IOS project that allows me to keep track of my mods I have done to my car. 
In this app, I am able to see how many parts I have installed on the car, what each item cost, and as well
as see the total cost of all the mods. The display menu is a tableView which allows me to scroll through my parts. This app is just a personal project of mine therefore it will not be deployed on the 
Appstore.
